In order to train a machine learning model, we need to describe everything in terms of numbers.  Images, words, and sounds are too abstract for a computer. But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking&#8211;”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics </span><a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as word2vec</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about machine learning with guests like Matt Zeiler, the founder of Clarif.ai and Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras.

A relational database engine that’s compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, and provides up to five times the performance of standard MySQL—on the same hardware, at a tenth of the cost. Amazon Aurora from AWS can scale up to millions of transactions per minute. Automatically grow your storage up to 64 terabytes. And replicates data to three different Availability Zones. And you don’t have to manage a thing. There are no upfront charges, no commitments—you only pay for what you use.

Bitcoin is the most well-known blockchain, but in the next decade we will see many more blockchains.

In his post, he walks you through how to write the code for a blockchain&#8211;just like any other web app. He starts with raw Python code, defines the data structures, and stands up his simple blockchain app on a web server to give a toy example for how nodes in a blockchain communicate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, this was a great article to read.

Paul had studied computer science, and was able to use his knowledge of high-performance computing to write an efficient graph database, and solve the other technical puzzles that the company faced&#8211;but the business did not ultimately work out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The failure of Tribe made the founders even hungrier for success&#8211;and it taught them lessons that they carried into subsequent businesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul went on to start Aggregate Knowledge, a marketing technology company that sold for $119 million. His Tribe co-founder Mark Pincus went on to start Zynga, the multi-billion dollar gaming company. Another Tribe employee co-founded Yammer, which sold to Microsoft for a billion dollars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his exit from Aggregate Knowledge, Paul Martino started Bullpen Capital, which makes post-seed investments. The Bullpen Capital portfolio is appealing to me&#8211;partly because of the number of Internet gambling companies. Paul and I talked about gambling and other taboo business sectors&#8211;as well as what makes a good investment in the “post-seed” category. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I enjoyed speaking to Paul because he has a straightforward, no-nonsense way of talking about things&#8211;it’s very charismatic and uncommon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have done some great shows with other engineering investors like Chris Dixon and Adrian Colyer.

I want to tell you about Scalyr, the first purpose built log management tool on the market. Most tools on the market utilize text indexing search, which is great&#8230; for indexing a book. But if you want to search logs, at scale, fast&#8230; it breaks down. Scalyr built their own database from scratch: the system is fast. Most searches take less than 1 second. In fact, 99% of their queries execute in &lt;1 second.  Companies like OKCupid, Giphy and CareerBuilder use Scalyr. It was built by one of the founders of Writely (aka Google Docs). Scalyr has consumer grade UI, that scales infinitely. You can monitor key metrics, trigger alerts, and integrate with PagerDuty. It&#8217;s easy to use and did we mention: lightning fast.

It was an ambitious idea&#8211;to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing corporations on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

Swiping left means you are not interested. Swiping right means you would like to connect with the person. The simple premise of Tinder has led to massive growth, and the app is now also used to discover new friends and create casual meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every social network knows&#8211;if you are not growing, then you are dying. Growth is so important to Tinder, they have a large engineering organization devoted to five facets of growth: new users, activation, retention, dropoff, and anti-spam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These five segments cover the entire Tinder user lifecycle, and there is a sub-team in charge of each of the five areas. No matter what kind of Tinder user you are, there are growth engineers focused on your experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Ross is the director of engineering for the growth team at Tinder. His job requires a mix of data science, data engineering, psychology, and setting proper KPIs (key performance indicators). Each subteam has KPIs that determine how well they are doing with growth&#8211;and if the wrong KPI is set, it can create bad incentives. For example, a growth team that is focused only on getting users to spend more time engaging with Tinder would have an incentive to create so-called “dark patterns” that trigger addiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about data science and data engineering.

Modern cloud applications are built using more sophisticated tools like Redis, Kafka, or Amazon S3. These tools do multiple things well, and often have overlapping functionality. Application architecture becomes less straightforward.</span></p>\n<p>The applications we are building today are data-intensive rather than compute-intensive. Netflix needs to know how to store and cache large video files, and stream them to users quickly. Twitter needs to update user news feeds with a fanout of the president’s latest tweet. These operations are simple with small amounts of data, but become complicated with a high volume of users.</p>\n<p>Martin Kleppmann is the author of <em>Data Intensive Applications</em>, an O’Reilly book about how to use modern data tools to solve modern data problems. His book includes high-level discussions about architectural strategy, and lower level discussions like how leader election algorithms can create problems for a data intensive application.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are interested in hosting a show for Software Engineering Daily, we are looking for engineers, journalists, and hackers who want to work with us on content.

Ethereum was designed to make smart contracts more usable for developers. Smart contracts are decentralized programs that usually allow for some a transaction between the owner of the contract and anyone who would want to purchase something from the contract owner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, I could set up a smart contract where a listener sends my smart contract some ether and I send the listener a podcast episode automatically. Smart contracts can also interact with each other, to network together complex transactions. In the same way that web development has been made easier by PaaS and SaaS, smart contracts will make building financial systems simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preethi Kasireddy is a blockchain developer who writes extensively about cryptocurrencies.

I want to tell you about Scalyr, the first purpose built log management tool on the market. Most tools on the market utilize text indexing search, which is great&#8230; for indexing a book. But if you want to search logs, at scale, fast&#8230; it breaks down. Scalyr built their own database from scratch: the system is fast. Most searches take less than 1 second. In fact, 99% of their queries execute in &lt;1 second.  Companies like OKCupid, Giphy and CareerBuilder use Scalyr. It was built by one of the founders of Writely (aka Google Docs). Scalyr has consumer grade UI, that scales infinitely. You can monitor key metrics, trigger alerts, and integrate with PagerDuty. It&#8217;s easy to use and did we mention: lightning fast. Give it a try today.
